free-sample-robot
=================

A robot built with nothing but free samples.

I plan to build a robot which is built soley from parts I got for free. I imagine most of these parts will come from online retailers and distributers.

**Rules:**

 - Everything which is used must be documented, where it came from, who it came from etc..
 - Parts which are found (i.e. in a dumpster) are "free" but are not considered a free sample and therefore cannot be used.
 - Free samples which are included with a purchase, or items thrown in as combinations are allowed, but definitely frowned upon.
 - Metioning building a free sameple robot while try to get free samples is also not allowed. The entity giving out the free samples must not be aware of your intentions.
